    <h1>Tech for Good</h1>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>

    <p><em>Tech for Good</em> is an exploratory, community-driven directory for those working in the South Africa tech-industry interested in using their skills for social good.</p>

    <p>Our hope is that this page provides the resources required for anyone, regardless of skill or experience level, to jump in and contribute to real-world projects using technology for good.</p>

    <h2>What do you want to do?</h2>

                We have discussion channels on both the <a href="https://zatech.github.io/site/">ZA Tech</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBPmaH71EuV3HTw-4KSB6x-Xs-6Euf3baSfsMt1wi8n9adkA/viewform">Code for Africa</a> Slack workspaces. These two channels are linked, which means that content is mirrored across both platforms (you can join either of these as a result).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are not familiar with Slack you can follow our <a href="guides/join-slack/index.html">step-by-step guide to join the channel</a>. However, if you prefer to use IRC you can also <a href="guides/use-irc.html">follow our IRC instructions</a> to link this channel to your IRC.

              <p>
                <em>Tech for Good</em> uses the forthnightly <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OpenUp/">Codebridge Community Evening</a> as our regular meeting space. This is first and foremost an opportunity for people to relax and connect (there is free pizza and beer!). However, we usually take about 30 minutes (for those interested) to do a catch-up on what everyone is working on and where people can get involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a couple of individuals joining in remotely via video/audio chat on a recurring basis. If you are interested in joining remotely have a look at our <a href="guides/join-remotely.html">remote meetup instructions</a>.

                <p>
                  We have a couple of projects driven by community members. The idea behind these projects is to provide easy entry points for individuals into real-world projects that use technology for good, regardless or experience of skill level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that if you are interested in getting involved in one of these projects we recommend that you join us (in person or remotely) at one of our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OpenUp/">fortnightly meetups in Cape Town</a> to learn more suitable projects. However, in the meantime, you can have a look at <a href="https://trello.com/b/TAPZltJQ/where-can-i-contribute">our Trello board</a> (where we keep track of active projects) and possibly reach out to project owners directly.

                    Although not necessarily geared towards facilitating contributions that are technological in nature, For Good (which has no affiliation with Tech for Good) is a directory that showcases specific requests that non-profit organisations seek to fulfil.
