    <h2>What is this?</h2>

    <p><em>Tech for Good</em> is an exploratory, community-driven directory for those working in the South Africa tech-industry interested in using their skills for social good.</p>

                We have discussion channels on both the <a href="https://zatech.github.io/site/">ZA Tech</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBPmaH71EuV3HTw-4KSB6x-Xs-6Euf3baSfsMt1wi8n9adkA/viewform">Code for Africa</a> Slack workspaces. These two channels are linked, which means that content is mirrored across both platforms (you can join either of these as a result).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are not familiar with Slack you can follow our <a href="guides/join-slack/index.html">step-by-step guide to join the channel</a>. In addition, if you prefer to use IRC (over Slack) you can <a href="guides/use-irc.html">follow our IRC instructions</a>

              <p>
                <em>Tech for Good</em> uses the forthnightly <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OpenUp/">Codebridge Community Evening</a> as our regular meeting space. This is first and foremost an opportunity for people to relax and connect (there is free pizza and beer!). However, we usually take about 30 minutes (for those interested) to do a catch-up on what everyone is working on and where people can get involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a couple of recurring individuals joining in remotely via video/audo chat. If you are interested in joining remotely have a look at our <a href="guides/join-remotely.html">remote meetup instructions</a>.
